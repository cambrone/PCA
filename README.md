# PCA
Group project to create tutorial about PCA in STATA, Python and R


This repository contains the code and data to reproduce the tutorial “Tutorial Principal Component Analysis and Regression: STATA, R and Python.” This tutorial was created as part of group component of the final project for STAT506-Statistical Computing. My group members were In Son Zeng and Hang Yuan. 

This tutorial covers the basics of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its applications to predictive modeling. The tutorial teaches readers how to implement this method in STATA, R and Python. A link to the tutorial can be found here: https://jbhender.github.io/Stats506/Projects/G18.html

In this tutorial, I was responsible for the section on STATA, introduction and compilation of the sections. 

The project covers the theoretical concepts and applications of the following topics:

•	Principal Component Analysis
•	Principal Component Regression 
•	Data Analysis with STATA
•	Data Analysis with Python
•	Data Analysis with R
